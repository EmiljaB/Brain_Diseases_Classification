# Brain_Diseases_Classification
## Bachelor Degree Thesis
Using Machine Learning and Depp Learning models to detect brain diseases using MRI and CT scans.
The dataset used for this implementation is privately owned so it won't be shared here.
The dataset contains MRI and CT scan images of Alzheimer's, Meningitis, Strokes, Tumor and normal brain.
## Models
Several models are used for this project: Feature extraction with LBP and GLCM, SVM, MLP trained with Backpropagation,
CNN, ResNet and UNET. Some visualisation codes are found here which visual LBP, GLCM, SVM and UNET masks.
Results for each model are also provided for submission requirements.
